# HoneyTrap
HoneyTrap is a lightweight yet powerful honeypot designed to detect and log unauthorized access attempts on SSH and HTTP services. It simulates vulnerable systems to attract attackers, capturing valuable threat intelligence while misleading malicious actors.

🚀 Features
✅ SSH Honeypot – Captures brute-force attacks, logs credentials, and attacker behavior.
✅ HTTP Honeypot – Mimics web applications to detect web-based attacks (SQLi, XSS, etc.).
✅ Logging & Analysis – Records attack details for further analysis.
✅ Customizable Traps – Configure fake vulnerabilities to lure attackers.
✅ Lightweight & Easy to Deploy – Runs on minimal hardware with Python.

⚙️ How It Works
Attackers attempting to log into the SSH service are monitored and logged.
Suspicious HTTP requests (e.g., scans, injections) are captured and stored.
Logs provide insights into attack patterns, malicious IPs, and exploit techniques.
